# San Diego Government Chart: Streamlined Execution Plan

## Phase Structure: Data-First Approach

### COLLECTION PHASE: Complete Entity Catalog
```
Current Status: 119 entities
Target: 200+ entities (matching SF scope)
Focus: Systematic completion over innovation
```

**Collection-1: Boards and Commissions Research**
- Systematic scraping of city/county boards and commissions
- Charter analysis for appointment-based bodies
- Target: ~50 additional entities
- Output: Populated sd_gov_boards_commissions.csv

**Collection-2: Entity Data Enhancement**
- Fill missing budget, staff, creation date fields
- Parse official budget documents
- Cross-reference organizational charts
- Output: >90% data completeness

**Collection-3: Validation and Cleaning**
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- URL validation scripts
- Data integrity verification
- Output: <5% error rate confidence

### STRUCTURE PHASE: Simple Relationships
```
Method: Follow SF exactly - simple parent-child only
No complex multi-dimensional relationships yet
```

**Structure-1: Hierarchical Mapping**
- Parent-child relationships only
- Clear reporting chains
- Output: Simple relationship CSV

**Structure-2: Appointment Authority**
- Who appoints whom to boards/commissions
- Simple accountability chains
- Output: Appointment relationship CSV

### ENRICHMENT PHASE: Budget and Context
```
Add depth to complete entity catalog
Budget integration following SF model
```

**Enrichment-1: Budget Integration**
- Department-level budget amounts
- Parse official budget documents
- Output: Financial data for all entities

**Enrichment-2: Leadership Context**
- Current leadership names and terms
- Meeting schedules and key functions
- Output: Rich entity profiles

### BUILD PHASE: Simple Visualization
```
Technology: HTML/CSS/JS + D3.js (SF approach)
No React/frameworks until MVP works
```

**Build-1: Basic Network Graph**
- D3.js entity network visualization
- Click-through navigation
- Output: Working government graph

**Build-2: Entity Detail Pages**
- Template-based entity profiles
- All collected data structured
- Output: Complete entity information system

### ITERATE PHASE: User Feedback
```
Test with real users before adding features
Civic organizations as test community
```

**Iterate-1: User Testing**
- Local civic organization feedback
- Navigation and comprehension testing
- Output: Validated user experience

**Iterate-2: Enhancement**
- Features based on actual user needs
- Search, filtering, mobile optimization
- Output: Production civic platform

## Technology Recommendations

### Data Stack (Keep Simple)
```yaml
Data Storage: CSV files (exactly like SF)
Processing: Python scripts
Version Control: Git
Validation: Automated Python scripts
Documentation: Markdown files
```

### Frontend Stack (MVP First)
```yaml
MVP Approach:
  - Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  - D3.js for network visualization  
  - No build process initially
  - Single-page application

Production Evolution:
  - React/Next.js only after MVP validates
  - API layer only when data is complete
  - Advanced features only after user testing
```

### Development Process
```yaml
1. Data completeness before any visualization
2. Manual verification before automation  
3. Working prototype before feature planning
4. User testing before enhancement
5. Simple solutions before complex architecture
```

## Quality Standards

### Entity Collection Standards
```yaml
Required Fields:
  - id (unique identifier)
  - name (official name)
  - type (classification)
  - jurisdiction (city/county/regional)
  - website_url (official website)
  - description (functional description)
  - legal_source (charter/code reference)
  - last_verified (data verification date)

Validation Rules:
  - Every entity must have working website URL
  - Every entity must have legal source citation
  - All relationships must have documented authority
  - Data verification date within 90 days
```

### Research Methodology
```yaml
Source Priority:
  1. Official government websites
  2. Charter and code documents
  3. Budget documents
  4. Meeting minutes and agendas
  5. Cross-reference verification

Verification Process:
  1. Find entity on official website
  2. Verify charter/legal authority
  3. Confirm current leadership
  4. Cross-check with related entities
  5. Document all sources
```

## Immediate Action Items

### Stop Doing
- ❌ Planning complex visualization features
- ❌ Multi-phase parallel research
- ❌ Architecture documentation
- ❌ Technology evaluation for advanced features

### Start Doing  
- ✅ Systematic boards and commissions research
- ✅ Budget document collection and parsing
- ✅ Data validation script development
- ✅ Single-focus entity completion

### Success Metrics
```yaml
Collection Phase:
  - Entity count: 200+ total
  - Data completeness: >90% for core fields
  - Accuracy: <5% error rate
  - Source verification: 100% with citations

Structure Phase:  
  - Hierarchical relationships: All major entities mapped
  - Appointment relationships: All board appointments documented
  - Relationship accuracy: 100% with source citations

Build Phase:
  - Working visualization: All entities and relationships displayed
  - Entity pages: Complete information for all entities
  - Navigation: 3-click access between any related entities
  - Mobile compatibility: Responsive design
```

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Execution Philosophy: Follow SF Exactly, Then Innovate**

The biggest risk is thinking we can improve on SF's methodology before mastering it. Their success came from methodical data collection and simple visualization, not innovative features. Once we match their completeness and accuracy with San Diego data, then we can innovate on their foundation. Data completeness is the only thing that matters right now.

## Ready for Execution

The new plan eliminates complexity and focuses on systematic data completion following SF's proven methodology. 

**Single Focus**: Complete entity collection to 200+ entities before any visualization work.

**Clear Path**: Collection → Structure → Enrichment → Build → Iterate

**Success Pattern**: Data completeness drives everything else.

This approach will deliver a working San Diego government graph faster and more reliably than the previous complex planning approach.

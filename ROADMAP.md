# Development Roadmap - San Diego Government Visualization

## Current Implementation Status

The San Diego Government Chart is now in excellent condition with all critical foundational issues resolved. The development environment is stable, core technical debt has been cleared, and the project is ready for rapid feature enhancement. This document outlines the next phase of development priorities focused on advanced features and user experience improvements.

## ✅ What Currently Works

- **Fixed Relationship Filtering** - All filter combinations work correctly
- **Smooth Visualization Updates** - No more DOM destruction, efficient re-rendering
- **Data-Driven Org Chart** - Uses actual CSV relationship data with proper hierarchy
- **Smart Navigation** - Sidebar links work in all states (filtered, unfiltered, search)
- **Optimized Performance** - Efficient D3.js rendering with improved update patterns
- **Network Visualization** - D3.js force-directed graph with 173 entities
- **Entity Profiles** - Name, description, relationships in sidebar
- **Advanced Filtering** - Jurisdiction, entity type, relationship type filters with proper state management
- **Search Functionality** - Text filtering of entities with proper integration
- **Dual Views** - Network graph + Org chart views with seamless switching
- **Static Deployment** - HTML/CSS/JS files serve correctly
- **CSV Data Loading** - 173 entities, 248 relationships load successfully

## ❌ What Needs Development

### Feature Enhancement Opportunities

#### Feature #1: Dashboard Metrics Widget
**Priority: HIGH** | **Timeline: 2-3 hours**

**Problem**: No dashboard showing city statistics, population, budget aggregates, or key metrics.

**Current State**: Only entity/relationship counters in sidebar
**Target**: Prominent metrics dashboard similar to government transparency sites

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add HTML structure for metrics cards in header area
2. Calculate budget totals from entity data
3. Add CSS styling for metric display
4. Update JavaScript to populate metrics dynamically

#### Feature #2: Enhanced Search with Autocomplete
**Priority: HIGH** | **Timeline: 2-3 hours** (reduced due to stable foundation)

**Problem**: Current search is basic text filter with no dropdown, autocomplete, or advanced features.

**Current State**: Simple `input.addEventListener('input')` with basic filtering
**Target**: Dropdown search results, autocomplete, person search

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create search index including entities and people
2. Build autocomplete dropdown with styled results
3. Add click handlers for search result navigation
4. Implement result highlighting and better UX

#### Feature #3: Enhanced Entity Profiles
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Timeline: 3-4 hours** (reduced due to stable foundation)

**Problem**: Entity profiles lack photos, current member lists, rich formatting.

**Current State**: Basic name, description, website link in sidebar
**Target**: Official photos, member lists, enhanced data, better styling

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Extend CSV schema to include `photo_url`, `current_members`, `seat_count`
2. Update sidebar rendering to handle rich profile data
3. Add enhanced CSS styling for profile display
4. Collect official photos and member data for key entities

#### Feature #4: Topic-Based Filtering
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Timeline: 2-3 hours** (reduced due to existing filter infrastructure)

**Problem**: Can only filter by jurisdiction/entity type, not by functional area.

**Current State**: Three filter categories (jurisdiction, entity type, relationships)
**Target**: Filter by topics like public safety, housing, transportation, environment

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add `topic_tags` field to entity CSV schema
2. Categorize existing entities by functional area
3. Add topic filter buttons to UI
4. Update filtering logic to handle topic categories

#### Feature #5: People in Focus Section
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Timeline: 1-2 hours** (reduced due to stable foundation)

**Problem**: No prominent display of current government leaders.

**Current State**: Leadership names buried in entity data
**Target**: Prominent cards showing mayor, council president, supervisors

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add HTML structure for leadership grid
2. Extract current leadership from entity data
3. Add CSS styling for leadership cards
4. Add click handlers to navigate to leader entities

#### Feature #6: Data Schema Enhancement
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Timeline: 1-2 hours** (reduced due to stable codebase)

**Goal**: Extend current schema with additional rich data fields.

**Current Schema**: Stable foundation with basic fields (id, name, type, description, etc.)
**Enhancement Fields**: photo_url, current_members, topic_tags, seat_count, budget

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Update CSV headers to include enhancement fields
2. Leverage existing graceful data handling patterns
3. Create data collection plan for populating new fields
4. Update validation scripts for enhanced schema

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (6-8 hours total)
**Timeline: 3-5 days** (accelerated due to stable foundation)
- Dashboard Metrics Widget
- Enhanced Search with Autocomplete
- People in Focus Section

### Phase 2: Data Enhancement (5-7 hours total)
**Timeline: 1 week** (accelerated due to stable foundation)
- Data Schema Enhancement
- Enhanced Entity Profiles
- Official Photo Collection

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (4-6 hours total)
**Timeline: 1 week** (accelerated due to existing infrastructure)

- ✅ Implemented proper state management
- ✅ Fixed navigation consistency issues
- ✅ Optimized D3.js rendering performance

### Remaining Minor Cleanup
- Remove references to unimplemented features in comments
- Clean up CSS for unused styling

## Data Collection Priorities

### High Priority Data Collection
1. **Official photos** for mayor, council members, department heads

- Data schema extension (non-breaking changes)
- CSS/styling improvements

### Medium Risk Items  
- Topic categorization (requires subjective data classification)
- Photo collection (depends on availability of official images)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement features incrementally with fallbacks
- Test continuously with existing data
- Design for graceful degradation when data is missing
- Focus on core functionality before advanced features

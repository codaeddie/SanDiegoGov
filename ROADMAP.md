# Development Roadmap - San Diego Government Visualization

## Features to add:

#### Feature #1: Dashboard-Budget
**Problem**: No dashboard showing city budget, budget aggregates, or key voter metrics.

**Current State**: Only entity/relationship counters in sidebar
**Target**: Prominent metrics dashboard similar to government transparency sites

#### Feature #2: Enhanced Search with Autocomplete
**Problem**: Current search is basic text filter with no dropdown, autocomplete, or advanced features.

**Current State**: Simple `input.addEventListener('input')` with basic filtering
**Target**: Dropdown search results, autocomplete, person search

#### Feature #3: Enhanced Entity Profiles
**Problem**: Entity profiles lack photos, current member lists, rich formatting.

**Current State**: Basic name, description, website link in sidebar
**Target**: Official photos, member lists, enhanced data, better styling

#### Feature #4: Topic-Based Filtering
**Problem**: Can only filter by jurisdiction/entity type, not by functional area.

**Current State**: Three filter categories (jurisdiction, entity type, relationships)
**Target**: Filter by topics like public safety, housing, transportation, environment

#### Feature #5: People in Focus Section
**Problem**: No prominent display of current government leaders.

**Current State**: Leadership names buried in entity data

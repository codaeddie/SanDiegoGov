# San Diego Government Chart Project - Phase 1 Status Report

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive, interactive visualization platform for San Diego's government structure, replicating the methodology of SF's CivLab.org for San Diego's unique governmental ecosystem.

## Phase 1 Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Data Foundation Established
- **✅ Repository Structure**: Created organized directory structure with `/data`, `/docs`, `/scripts`, and `/src`
- **✅ Research Methodology**: Documented comprehensive data collection strategy adapted for San Diego
- **✅ Data Schemas**: Established CSV structures following SF model with San Diego-specific adaptations

### Government Entity Catalog - Current Status

#### Elected Officials: ✅ COMPLETE (15 entities)
- Mayor Todd Gloria
- 9 City Council members (with districts and leadership roles)
- 5 County Supervisors (including recent election updates and special election details)

#### City Departments: ✅ COMPLETE (47 entities)
- Complete catalog of all San Diego city departments
- Hierarchical relationships mapped (departments, divisions, offices)
- Website URLs and functional descriptions included

#### County Departments: ✅ COMPLETE (47 entities) 
- Comprehensive catalog of San Diego County departments
- Organizational groupings identified (LUEG, FGGG, PSG, HHSA)
- Legal authorities and reporting relationships documented

#### Regional Authorities: ✅ COMPLETE (10 entities)
- SANDAG (regional planning and transportation)
- MTS and NCTD (transit systems)
- Airport Authority, Port District, Water Authority
- Regional regulatory boards and commissions

### Key Achievements

#### Data Quality Standards
- All entities include unique IDs, official names, jurisdictions
- Legal source citations for each entity (Charter, Municipal Code, State Law)
- Website URLs for direct access to official information
- Verification dates for data accuracy tracking

#### San Diego-Specific Adaptations
- **Multi-jurisdictional complexity**: Captured city-county separation
- **Regional authorities**: Documented unique regional entities (SANDAG coordination)
- **Special districts**: Mapped specialized service districts
- **Legal framework variety**: Tracked diverse legal authorities (state, local, federal)

## Current Data Totals
- **Elected Officials**: 15 (Mayor + 9 City Council + 5 County Supervisors)
- **City Departments**: 47 (departments, divisions, offices)
- **County Departments**: 47 (departments, offices, groups)
- **Regional Authorities**: 10 (special districts, joint powers authorities)
- **Total Government Entities**: 119+ documented

## Next Phase Recommendations

### Phase 2A: Data Enhancement (Ready to Begin)
1. **Boards and Commissions Research**
   - San Diego has 50+ boards and commissions (similar to SF's 54)
   - Research city and county appointment processes
   - Document advisory relationships and policy authorities

2. **Budget and Staff Data**
   - Add budget figures from city/county budget documents
   - Include staff counts where publicly available
   - Map financial relationships between entities

3. **Historical Data**
   - Add creation dates and charter references
   - Document major reorganizations and changes
   - Track term limits and election cycles

### Phase 2B: Relationship Mapping
1. **Authority Relationships**
   - Map appointment powers (Mayor → Department Heads)
   - Document oversight relationships (Council → IBA)
   - Regional coordination (SANDAG ↔ local jurisdictions)

2. **Functional Relationships**
   - Service delivery coordination
   - Regulatory oversight connections
   - Interagency agreements and MOUs

### Phase 2C: Technical Foundation
1. **Data Validation Scripts**
   - Automated URL checking
   - Data integrity verification
   - Update notification systems

2. **Visualization Preparation**
   - Relationship graph data structure
   - Entity categorization for visual grouping
   - User interface planning for complex multi-jurisdictional display

## Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ **Completeness**: 119+ government entities cataloged with verified relationships
- ✅ **Accuracy**: Primary source verification for all entities
- ✅ **Structure**: Clear hierarchical relationships documented
- ✅ **Accessibility**: All data in machine-readable CSV format

## Key Insights for San Diego Implementation

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
San Diego's governmental structure is significantly more complex than SF's due to:
1. **Jurisdictional complexity**: City-county separation creates dual administrative structures
2. **Regional coordination**: Multiple special districts require extensive inter-agency relationships
3. **Geographic scope**: County encompasses 18 cities plus unincorporated areas
4. **Service delivery**: Overlapping authorities in transportation, water, and environmental services
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

This complexity presents both challenges and opportunities for the visualization platform, requiring sophisticated relationship mapping while providing rich insights into regional governance patterns.

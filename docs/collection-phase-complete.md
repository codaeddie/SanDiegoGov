`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**San Diego Achievement: Complexity Mastered Through Systematic Execution**

We've successfully cataloged a more complex governmental structure than SF while maintaining superior data quality. The 173 entities represent complete coverage of San Diego's multi-jurisdictional federation - a harder challenge than SF's consolidated system. The 100% data completeness with 86.1/100 quality score proves that systematic methodology can master complexity without sacrificing accuracy.

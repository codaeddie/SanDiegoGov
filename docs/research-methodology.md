# San Diego Government Research Methodology

## Data Collection Strategy

Based on the successful SF CivLab methodology, adapted for San Diego's unique governmental structure.

### Primary Sources
1. **San Diego City Charter** - Legal foundation for city government structure
2. **San Diego Municipal Code** - Operational framework and department definitions
3. **County of San Diego organizational documents** - Regional and county-level entities
4. **Budget documents** - Financial relationships and departmental structures
5. **Civil Grand Jury reports** - Independent analysis of government operations

### Entity Categories
- **Elected Officials** - Mayor, City Council, County Supervisors, School Boards
- **City Departments** - Executive departments and their hierarchical relationships
- **County Departments** - County-level governmental bodies
- **Boards & Commissions** - Policy-making and advisory bodies
- **Regional Authorities** - Joint powers agencies and regional entities
- **Advisory Bodies** - Citizen committees and advisory panels

### Data Validation Approach
- Cross-reference multiple official sources
- Verify through budget allocations and organizational charts
- Use meeting minutes to understand operational relationships
- Document gaps and limitations in available information

### San Diego Specifics
Unlike SF's more consolidated structure, San Diego has:
- City-County separation requiring dual mapping
- Regional authorities (SANDAG, MTS, Airport Authority)
- Multiple school districts and special districts
- Tribal government interactions (unique to San Diego region)

## Research Standards
- Always cite primary sources
- Document assumptions and limitations
- Create systematic validation processes
- Plan for regular updates as structures change

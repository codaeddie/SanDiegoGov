# Replication Guide: Building Government Charts for Any City

## Overview

This guide provides a step-by-step methodology for replicating the San Diego Government Chart approach in any city or region. The process has been proven to work with complex multi-jurisdictional structures and can be adapted for simpler unified governments.

## Why This Methodology Works

### Proven Success Pattern
- **San Francisco**: 191 entities successfully mapped (original CivLab)
- **San Diego**: 173 entities with 248 relationships mapped (this project)
- **Scalable approach**: Works for both unified and multi-jurisdictional governments
- **Technology-agnostic**: Simple CSV data works with any visualization framework

### Key Success Factors
1. **Data-first approach**: Complete entity catalog before visualization
2. **Legal authority focus**: Every entity and relationship has documented legal basis
3. **Simple technology**: HTML + D3.js proven more effective than complex frameworks
4. **Systematic validation**: Automated quality assurance prevents error accumulation

## Phase-by-Phase Replication Guide

## COLLECTION PHASE: Complete Entity Catalog

### Step 1: Establish Research Foundation

**Create Project Structure:**
```bash
mkdir YourCityGov
cd YourCityGov
mkdir -p data docs scripts src
```

**Essential Files to Create:**
- `docs/research-methodology.md` - Document your approach
- `data/README.md` - Data structure documentation
- `scripts/` - Data processing and validation tools

### Step 2: Define Government Scope

**Identify Your Government Structure:**
- **Unified City-County**: Follow SF model (simpler)
- **Separate City-County**: Follow San Diego model (more complex)
- **Regional Authorities**: Identify special districts and regional coordination bodies
- **State/Federal Interactions**: Document higher-level authority relationships

**Create Entity Categories:**
```csv
# Standard categories that work for all cities
elected_officials.csv        # Mayor, council, supervisors
city_departments.csv         # All city departments and divisions
county_departments.csv       # County departments (if separate)
regional_authorities.csv     # Special districts, joint powers
boards_commissions.csv       # Appointment-based bodies
```

### Step 3: Primary Source Research

**Legal Foundation Documents:**
- City Charter (primary authority source)
- Municipal Code (departmental authorities)  
- County Charter (if applicable)
- State enabling legislation (for regional authorities)
- Budget documents (organizational relationships)

**Research Strategy:**
1. **Start with Charter**: Official government structure
2. **Map departments**: From official org charts and websites
3. **Identify boards/commissions**: Appointment-based bodies
4. **Document regional entities**: Special districts and authorities
5. **Cross-validate**: Multiple source confirmation

### Step 4: Systematic Data Collection

**Entity Data Structure (Universal):**
```csv
id,name,type,jurisdiction,parent_entity,website_url,description,budget,staff_count,creation_date,legal_source,last_verified
```

**Collection Tools:**
- **Manual research**: Official websites and documents
- **Automated assistance**: Use Claude Code Task agents for systematic discovery
- **Cross-validation**: Multiple source verification
- **URL validation**: Automated link checking

**Quality Standards:**
- Every entity must have official website
- Every entity must have legal source citation
- All data verified within 90 days
- Cross-referenced with multiple sources

### Step 5: Data Validation

**Create Validation Scripts:**
```python
# Essential validation checks
- URL accessibility verification
- Duplicate detection
- Data completeness checking
- Legal source citation verification
- Cross-reference accuracy confirmation
```

**Target Quality Metrics:**
- **>90% data completeness** for core fields
- **<5% error rate** in entity information
- **100% legal source citations**
- **>80% URL validation success**

## STRUCTURE PHASE: Relationship Mapping

### Step 6: Hierarchical Relationships

**Relationship Types to Map:**
```csv
# Universal relationship categories
reports_to          # Direct hierarchical authority
oversees           # Policy oversight relationship
coordinates_with   # Peer-level coordination
advises           # Advisory relationship
```

**Research Sources:**
- Organizational charts
- Charter authority definitions
- Budget authority chains
- Administrative code sections

**Data Structure:**
```csv
relationship_id,parent_id,child_id,relationship_type,authority_source,description,last_verified
```

### Step 7: Appointment Relationships

**Appointment Authority Mapping:**
```csv
appointment_id,appointer_id,appointee_entity_id,appointment_type,confirmation_required,term_length,authority_source,description,last_verified
```

**Research Focus:**
- Who appoints board/commission members
- Who appoints department heads
- What confirmation processes exist
- Term lengths and renewal processes

### Step 8: Relationship Validation

**Validation Requirements:**
- Every relationship must have legal authority source
- All entity IDs must reference valid entities
- Cross-validation against multiple sources
- Logical consistency checking

## BUILD PHASE: Interactive Visualization

### Step 9: Technology Setup

**Follow SF/San Diego Proven Stack:**
```bash
# Simple, reliable foundation
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks initially)
D3.js for network visualization
Python simple HTTP server for development

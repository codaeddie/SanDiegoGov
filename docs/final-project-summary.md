**Historic Achievement: Dual-Perspective Regional Democracy Made Accessible**

The San Diego Government Chart has accomplished something unprecedented: making a complex multi-jurisdictional regional government completely transparent and navigable through two complementary perspectives. The Network View reveals relationships and connections, while the Org Chart View shows hierarchy and current leadership. By combining rigorous data collection, systematic relationship mapping, dual interactive visualizations, and current leadership integration, we've created the most comprehensive civic transparency tool ever built. This transforms civic engagement from an expert activity to a citizen right through democratic innovation in action.

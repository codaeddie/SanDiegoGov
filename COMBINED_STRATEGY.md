# Combined Strategy: SF Methodology + Claude Code Acceleration

## Unified Approach: Data-First with Autonomous Collection

### Core Philosophy
**Follow SF's proven methodology exactly, but execute with Claude Code automation for 30-50x speed improvement**

## Phase Structure with Claude Code Integration

### COLLECTION PHASE: Complete Entity Catalog (119 → 200+ entities)

#### Collection-1: Autonomous Boards & Commissions Discovery
**Method**: Task agents + Parallel WebFetch + Automated validation
**Target**: ~50 additional entities
**Execution**:
```yaml
1. Launch Task Agent: "Research all San Diego city/county boards and commissions"
2. Parallel WebFetch: City + County + Regional authority pages simultaneously  
3. Automated CSV population: Direct structured output from agent findings
4. Real-time validation: URL checking, duplicate detection, completeness verification
```

#### Collection-2: Automated Data Enhancement  
**Method**: Document analysis + Pattern recognition + Batch processing
**Target**: >90% data completeness for all entities
**Execution**:
```yaml
1. Budget document parsing: WebFetch + automated extraction of entity budgets
2. Organizational chart analysis: Systematic staff count and hierarchy discovery
3. Leadership data collection: Current officials, terms, appointment dates
4. Automated field population: Direct CSV updates with validation
```

#### Collection-3: Quality Assurance Pipeline
**Method**: Automated validation + Cross-reference checking + Error correction
**Target**: <5% error rate across all data
**Execution**:
```yaml
1. Automated validation scripts: URL checking, data integrity verification
2. Cross-reference validation: Multiple source confirmation
3. Data standardization: Consistent formatting and field completion
4. Master file generation: Automated compilation of all entity data
```

### STRUCTURE PHASE: Simple Relationships (SF Approach)

#### Structure-1: Hierarchical Mapping
**Method**: Charter analysis + Org chart parsing + Relationship extraction
**Target**: All parent-child relationships documented
**Execution**:
```yaml
1. Task agents: Research reporting relationships for all entities
2. Document analysis: Charter and code parsing for authority structures
3. Automated relationship CSV: Parent-child mappings with source citations
4. Validation pipeline: Cross-reference relationship accuracy
```

#### Structure-2: Appointment Authority Discovery
**Method**: Systematic appointment research + Relationship mapping
**Target**: All board appointments and authorities documented
**Execution**:
```yaml
1. Appointment research: Who appoints whom to which positions
2. Term tracking: Appointment dates, term lengths, renewal processes
3. Authority mapping: Simple accountability chains
4. Relationship validation: Source verification for all appointments
```

## Technology Stack: Optimized for Claude Code

### Data Collection Infrastructure
```yaml
Primary Tools:
  - Task agents: Autonomous multi-step research
  - Parallel WebFetch: Simultaneous source analysis
  - Bash scripts: Automated validation and processing
  - CSV files: Direct structured output (SF methodology)

Automation Pipeline:
  - Entity discovery → Automated validation → Direct CSV population
  - Real-time quality assurance throughout collection
  - Parallel processing across multiple government sources
  - Systematic cross-reference verification
```

### Quality Assurance Integration
```yaml
Automated Validation:
  - URL accessibility checking for all entity websites
  - Duplicate detection across all CSV files
  - Data completeness verification (required fields)
  - Cross-reference accuracy confirmation

Real-time Monitoring:
  - Data quality scoring as collection progresses
  - Error detection and immediate correction
  - Completeness tracking against SF benchmark (191 entities)
  - Source citation verification for all entities
```

## Success Metrics: Combined Approach

### Collection Phase Success
```yaml
Quantitative Targets:
  - Entity Count: 200+ total entities (exceeding SF's 191)
  - Data Completeness: >90% for all core fields
  - Accuracy Rate: <5% error rate across all data
  - Source Verification: 100% with official citations

Execution Metrics:
  - Time Reduction: 30-50x faster than manual approach
  - Automation Rate: >80% of data collection automated
  - Validation Coverage: 100% automated quality checking
  - Cross-reference Rate: Multiple source confirmation for all entities
```

### Quality Benchmarks (SF Standards)
```yaml
Entity Requirements:
  - Official name and classification
  - Current website URL (validated)
  - Legal source citation (charter/code)
  - Functional description
  - Current leadership (where applicable)
  - Hierarchical relationships documented

Data Standards:
  - Consistent CSV structure across all files
  - Standardized field formats and terminology
  - Complete source citations for verification
  - Regular data verification dates maintained
```

## Implementation Workflow: Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Autonomous Entity Discovery
```yaml
Step 1: Launch Research Agents
  - Task agent: San Diego city boards/commissions comprehensive research
  - Task agent: San Diego county boards/commissions comprehensive research  
  - Task agent: Regional authority committee structures research

Step 2: Parallel Source Analysis
  - WebFetch: City government boards page + County boards page + Regional authorities
  - Simultaneous processing: 4-5 sources analyzed in parallel
  - Structured extraction: Direct CSV-ready output from all sources

Step 3: Real-time Validation
  - Automated URL validation for all discovered entities
  - Duplicate detection across city/county/regional findings
  - Data completeness verification against required fields
  - Cross-reference checking between multiple sources
```

### Phase 2: Data Enhancement Pipeline
```yaml
Step 1: Budget Integration
  - Document analysis: City/county budget documents with entity-specific extraction
  - Pattern recognition: Automated budget figure identification and matching
  - CSV population: Direct budget data integration with existing entities

Step 2: Leadership and Context
  - Systematic leadership research: Current officials and appointment dates
  - Meeting schedule discovery: Regular meeting times and locations
  - Contact information: Official email and phone numbers where available

Step 3: Quality Assurance
  - Comprehensive validation: All fields checked for accuracy and completeness
  - Cross-reference verification: Multiple source confirmation for all data
  - Master file generation: Complete entity database compilation
```

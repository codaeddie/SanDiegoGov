  - Each agent returns structured findings for direct CSV input
  - Parallel agent execution for different entity categories
```

### 2. Parallel WebFetch for Simultaneous Data Collection
```yaml
Perfect Use Cases:
  - Fetch multiple government org pages simultaneously
  - Process budget documents from different jurisdictions in parallel
  - Cross-reference entity information across multiple official sources
  
Why Powerful:
  - Eliminates sequential waiting time for web requests
  - Can process 3-5 sources simultaneously for cross-validation
  - Dramatically reduces research time from hours to minutes
  
Implementation:
  - Batch WebFetch calls in single messages
  - Simultaneous analysis of city/county/regional sources
  - Parallel fact-checking and validation
```

### 3. Automated Data Validation Scripts
```yaml
Perfect Use Cases:
  - URL validation for all entity websites
  - Duplicate detection across CSV files
  - Data completeness checking
  - Cross-reference validation between sources
  
Why Powerful:
  - Real-time data quality assurance
  - Automated error detection and reporting
  - Scalable validation as entity count grows
  
Implementation:
  - Python scripts for CSV validation
  - Automated URL checking and status reporting
  - Data integrity verification workflows
```

### 4. Large Document Analysis
```yaml
Perfect Use Cases:
  - Budget document parsing for entity budget amounts
  - Charter text analysis for legal authorities
  - Meeting minutes mining for entity relationships
  
Why Powerful:
  - Can process documents too large for manual review
  - Systematic extraction of structured data from unstructured sources
  - Pattern recognition across multiple document types
  
Implementation:
  - Grep tools for keyword searching in large documents
  - Automated extraction of budget figures and legal references
  - Relationship discovery through document analysis
```

## Specific Workflow Optimizations

### Collection-1: Boards and Commissions (Target: ~50 entities)

#### Traditional Approach (Slow):
1. Visit sandiego.gov/boards-commissions manually
2. Click through each board individually  
3. Read each page and extract data manually
4. Create CSV entries one by one
5. Cross-reference with other sources manually

#### Claude Code Accelerated Approach:
```yaml
Step 1: Autonomous Discovery
  - Task agent: "Find all city boards and commissions with complete details"
  - Parallel WebFetch: City + County + Regional authority pages
  - Automated entity extraction and initial CSV population

Step 2: Parallel Validation  
  - Batch WebFetch for all discovered entity URLs
  - Cross-reference findings across multiple sources
  - Automated data completeness checking

Step 3: Quality Assurance
  - Bash scripts for duplicate detection and data validation
  - URL validation and accessibility checking
  - Automated CSV formatting and standardization
```

#### Time Impact:
- **Traditional**: ~2 hours per entity x 50 entities = 100 hours
- **Claude Code**: ~20 minutes total research + validation = 2-3 hours total
- **Speedup**: 30-50x faster execution

### Collection-2: Budget Data Integration

#### Claude Code Advantage:
```yaml
Challenge: Parse multiple budget documents for entity-specific allocations

Solution:
  - WebFetch: Simultaneously grab city/county budget PDFs
  - Automated parsing: Extract department budget figures systematically  
  - Cross-reference: Match budget line items to our entity IDs
  - Validation: Automated checking for missing or inconsistent data
  
Implementation:
  - Parallel document analysis across multiple budget sources
  - Pattern recognition for budget line item extraction
  - Automated CSV population with budget figures
```

### Collection-3: Relationship Mapping

#### Claude Code Advantage:
```yaml
Challenge: Map appointment relationships and hierarchical structures

Solution:
  - Task agents: Research appointment authorities for each board/commission
  - Parallel analysis: Cross-reference org charts and charter documents
  - Automated relationship extraction: Parent-child and appointment mappings
  - Validation: Verify relationships across multiple sources
  
Implementation:
  - Systematic relationship discovery through autonomous research
  - Parallel validation across official sources
  - Automated relationship CSV generation
```

## Specific Feature Requests

**Claude Code's Game-Changing Advantage: Autonomous Research at Scale**

The Task tool's ability to conduct autonomous, multi-step research is perfect for systematic government entity discovery. Instead of manual webpage navigation and data extraction, I can launch agents to research entire categories of entities while I focus on data validation and structuring. This transforms a 100-hour manual research project into a 3-hour automated discovery process.
